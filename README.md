# Comparison of Sentiment of User vs Manufacturers on fitness trackers, using reviews of Amazon

## Abstract

### Fitness trackers encourage teens and adults to count their steps and be more active, people with obesity to lose weight and track their diet, and older adults to understand their health by knowing their heart rate. Companies display advertisements for these types of products and describe them as beneficial. In this studio we evaluate the opinion of users, testing the veracity of the technical characteristics that device offer. Using natural language processing techniques, we construct an analysis based on technical aspects and user sentiment. The RoBERTa model was pretrained, extracting 19 technical aspects (96% precision), and classifying aspects (70% precision). A comparison was made between the average sentiment of the users versus that of the manufacturer, grouped by aspects. Estimating the difference between the user's sentiment and the manufacturer's, concluding that there is a difference of 0.88 (3.11 Users ~ 3.99 Manufacturer), with the user's sentiment having a lower expectation than the manufacturers
